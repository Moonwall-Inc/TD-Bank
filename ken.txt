This will be a test run
Team 4 has been wonderful so far
I have enjoyed every bit of the training we had
Thanks to the team lead and other wonderful members
We are really making progress
echo "This is the winning team"
echo "Go Team 4"
echo "Team 4 will emerge as champions"
echo "This is because we are goal getters"
